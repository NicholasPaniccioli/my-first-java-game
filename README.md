# My First Java Game

Yep you read that right, after taking some time to learn the basics of Java
I thought to myself I should try to make a small game. Something where I can
practice with everything I've learned so far and to help me get more comfortable
with Java.

## My Goal

I hope to create a fun portfolio quality piece that I can show off. I also hope that it will give me a better understanding of Java and push me towards other avenues to learn more about it when I run into obstacles or have questions about things I may not particularly understand.

## The Game

The game that I currently have in mind will be something heavily inspired by a classic boardgame Battleship. However instead of simply copying and pasting the basic gameplay of trial and error shooting to sink ships, I plan on adding my own twist to it. 
- First, give it an entirely new theme, I'm thinking fantasy.
- Second, the addition of 'special' pieces that will have different values and abilites
- Thirdly, more than one attack per turn (...or even no attacks on a turn)

Of course I will first have to make the base game, to ensure I have something to work with, but the goal being to create a simple game and get some practice with Java. Once the base game has been created I can then begin to get more complex and as a result more creative with how I may use Java to create the game I have in mind.

## Updates

Hello and welcome to the many updates of my first game in Java!

### 1/17/23
- As it currently stands and with the update matching this date, the most basic mechanics of the game are now working!
- IE Placing Pieces & Hitting Pieces
- Now while, those tasks in themselves weren't the most difficult the biggest struggle I had was the logic and checking for any rule breaking. Such as not placing the pieces in diagonals or checking there was enough room for the piece or even that the coordinate given was a valid one. With it now done!
- Below you'll see what it looks like now:
