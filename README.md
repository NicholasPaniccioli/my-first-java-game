# My First Java Game

Yep you read that right, after taking some time to learn the basics of Java
I thought to myself I should try to make a small game. Something where I can
practice with everything I've learned so far and to help me get more comfortable
with Java.

## My Goal

I hope to create a fun portfolio quality piece that I can show off. I also hope that it will give me a better understanding of Java and push me towards other avenues to learn more about it when I run into obstacles or have questions about things I may not particularly understand.

## The Game

The game that I currently have in mind will be something heavily inspired by a classic boardgame Battleship. However instead of simply copying and pasting the basic gameplay of trial and error shooting to sink ships, I plan on adding my own twist to it. 
- First, give it an entirely new theme, I'm thinking fantasy.
- Second, the addition of 'special' pieces that will have different values and abilites
- Thirdly, more than one attack per turn (...or even no attacks on a turn)

Of course I will first have to make the base game, to ensure I have something to work with, but the goal being to create a simple game and get some practice with Java. Once the base game has been created I can then begin to get more complex and as a result more creative with how I may use Java to create the game I have in mind.
